Project 3

"today seems like a good day to go out and find some ancient artifacts i guess"

For the final project, I wanted to make a game from scratch. I didn't know what kind of game it would be, what it would be about, or what you were supposed to do. So with that, I looked up whatever tutorials online on how to make a game in Phaser 3.

Since I wanted to do everything from scratch, I knew I couldn't dream too big. Aesthetically, I took inspiration from Bitsy games which use game screens of 16x16 blocks made up up 8x8 pixels, and a maximum of 3 colours per screen. I prototyped my tileset in the Bitsy app, and then using the online tool Piskel, began drawing the tiles and a few sprites I would use in my game.

At this point, I had basically decided it was a 2D, top-down, adventure game. However, I did not want puzzles and I did not want any combat. I wanted it to be overtly silly but with a tinge of mystery - where silliness could be mysterious and where mystery could be absurd.

I don't know where the theme of "Ancient Artifacts" came from, and it doesn't matter. This was going to be a game about going out there and finding things, so I came up with some silly Ancient Artifacts like the Spectacles of Reality, and added little flavour text when you picked them up. I was doing this at the same time as I was designing my levels & world, which I will talk about now.

I did not want it to be "non-linear", because I didn't want anyone to get actually lost or not know what to do - but I wanted it to FEEL non-linear. The first thing I began doing when designing the locations where the artifacts would be placed is that, in general, you would see the item before you see the path to get to the item. You see it - you know it's there - you make a note of it - and you continue on, knowing that there must be some way to get there. This was the basis of the level design design and item placement, as well as the width of the camera itself.
