Project 3

"today seems like a good day to go out and find some ancient artifacts i guess"

For the final project, I wanted to make a game from scratch. I didn't know what kind of game it would be, what it would be about, or what you were supposed to do. So with that, I looked up whatever tutorials online on how to make a game in Phaser 3.

Since I wanted to do everything from scratch, I knew I couldn't dream too big. Aesthetically, I took inspiration from Bitsy games which use game screens of 16x16 blocks made up up 8x8 pixels, and a maximum of 3 colours per screen. I prototyped my tileset in the Bitsy app, and then using the online tool Piskel, began drawing the tiles and a few sprites I would use in my game.

At this point, I had basically decided it was a 2D, top-down, adventure game. However, I did not want puzzles and I did not want any combat. I wanted it to be overtly silly but with a tinge of mystery - where silliness could be mysterious and where mystery could be absurd.

If you haven't played through it fully yet, I suggest you do so now so that you can form your own interpretation, and then read my intentions.

I don't know where the theme of "Ancient Artifacts" came from, and it doesn't matter. This was going to be a game about going out there and finding things, so I came up with some silly Ancient Artifacts like the Spectacles of Reality, and added little flavour text when you picked them up. I was doing this at the same time as I was designing my levels & world.

I did not want it to be "non-linear", because I didn't want anyone to get actually lost or not know what to do - but I wanted it to FEEL non-linear. The first thing I began doing when designing the locations where the artifacts would be placed is that, in general, you would see the item before you see the path to get to the item. You see it - you know it's there - you make a note of it - and you continue on, knowing that there must be some way to get there. This was the basis of the level design design and item placement, as well as the width of the camera itself.

My primary concern for world design was contrast. Starting in a dark room, exiting to a field and beach, heading underground, emerging into a moving forest, back into some dark ruins, emerging to find the Ancient Tree Spirit among a bright field of flowers... I liked this idea of going back and forth between compact, dark spaces and bright, more open spaces as a way of levying playing fatigue.

The theme of this game is being able to find meaning in things. Every NPC encounter - with Max, for example - and every Artifact is meant to reinforce this theme, right from the beginning of the game, where you find a pile of books, each of which seem meaningless or, at the least, "random". Even after going around the long way to talk to Max at a dead end, he tells you it doesn't have to mean anything and not to let it get to you. The Artifacts were written following the original concept of silly vs. mysterious, but also to make you think: "does this mean something? Does this mean absolutely nothing?" You're meant to both like and be suspicious of Max, because you don't really have any idea of what's going on. He does give hints that he's letting on a lot less than he knows, though.

I want to leave the part with the Ancient Tree Spirit up to interpretation. I've mostly spelt out clearly the themes of the game in this writeup, and the Tree is basically bringing home all those concepts and making them slightly more obvious, right before the game ends.

I spent a long time drawing frame-by-frame the animations for everything. It's part of how I tried to give Max a personality. If I had more time, I would give him a different tail wagging animation every time you saw him (that was the original intention) - but I ended up fleshing him out in other ways, whether it's by having him sleep or drinking water.

The music was all composed by a friend of mine, Owen Gilbride. He did not compose them for the game: I picked tracks from various releases from the past few years. Originally, I was going to make the music the game, but I had only half of it done by crunch time and I wanted all the music to be aesthetically cohesive (except for the end theme, It's All In Your Mind by Beck).

The biggest regret that I have was being unable to incorporate tile animations. They're all there! I just couldn't get them to work without rewriting how I instantiated the tiles, which I still want to do. Take a look at the animations in the Tiled editor, if you get the chance... I spent a very long time animating the Ancient Tree Spirit.

Overall, I went a little overboard when it came to minimalism. I spent an unbelievable amount of time on the tiniest of details - basically borderline obsessive, but I wanted to convey something "cool" with relatively little, and I feel like I managed to do that.
